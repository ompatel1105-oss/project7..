# Project 7 – Python Utility Menu Application

## Overview
This project is a Python-based utility program that provides multiple menus for performing common operations such as:
- Date & time utilities
- Mathematical calculations
- Random number generation
- String manipulations
- UUID generation
- OS and module-related utilities

The program uses a menu-driven interface allowing users to select specific functionalities interactively.

## Features
### 1. Date & Time Utilities
- Display current date and time
- Calculate the difference between two dates
- Format and display current date
- Simple stopwatch
- Countdown timer

### 2. Mathematical Utilities
- Basic arithmetic and advanced math functions using the math module

### 3. Random Utilities
- Generate random numbers, choices, and strings using the random and string modules

### 4. UUID Utilities
- Generate unique identifiers using the uuid module

### 5. OS Utilities
- Display current working directory
- List files in directory
- Import and reload Python modules dynamically using importlib

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies (uses only standard library)

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the notebook or exported .py file.
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or execute the exported script:
   ```bash
   python "project 7.py"
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen menu prompts to use the utilities.

## File Structure
```
project 7.ipynb        # Jupyter Notebook containing the utility menus
```

## Notes
- Each menu runs in a loop until you choose to exit or go back.
- The program uses standard library modules like datetime, time, math, random, string, uuid, os, and importlib.
